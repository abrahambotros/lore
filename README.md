# LORE
Light Object-Relational Environment (LORE) provides a very simple and lightweight pseudo-ORM/pseudo-struct-mapping environment for Go

## Motivation
With LORE, you weave your own lore and make your own magic (... bear with me, I'll explain). LORE provides a thin veil that abstracts away some of the inconveniences of object-relational mapping in general, but intentionally and explicitly avoids doing any hand-wavy magic tricks that place someone else's mystery black box between you and your data.

## DANGER: WIP
LORE is a major WIP. Contributions are welcome, but use in production is cautioned against at the moment unless you know full well what you're doing!

## Getting Started

## Example

## TODO
* Allow using QueryRow/QueryRowX for large/unrestricted-length queries instead of just Get/Select.
* Note Go 1.6
* Note that provides some convenient wrappers/helpers (SelectStar(), InsertColumnsAndValues(), etc.).
